Autentication is the process of verifying who a user is
Authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to 
Example: Alice is a user in AWS with no access to any service

For AWS provider we have access keys and secret keys as part of credentials

Before starting with AWS, we need to create a user, with adminaccess permission
and create a access and secret key which will need later using terraform
for the authentication and authorization.


Terraform init - plugins required for the providers are automatically downloaded
and saved localley to a .terrform directory

resource "aws_instance" "firstec2"

firstec2 - this is local name

state file - contains all the data regarding your resource.
hcl.lock file, have the provider version stored

terraform refresh command is depricated in newer version of terraform
